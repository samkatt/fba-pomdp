/**
 * @brief The coffee benchmark problem
 *
 * There are two versions, one used by poupart in his master thesis (default)
 * and the other is used by Boutilier and Poole in their 1996 paper (boutilier)
 *
 * Features a robot that must purchase coffee at a coffee shop and deliver it
 * to a user. The state space is defined by 5 Boolean variables indicating
 * whether the user has coffee HC, the user wants coffee WC,
 * it is raining R, the robot is wet W, the robot carries an umbrella
 * U.  The robot has two actions: get coffee, getC and check whether the user
 * wants coffee checkWC. All variables remain unchanged except those for
 * which a conditional probability table is given. When the rob ot gets coffee,
 * it must go across the street to the local coffee shop to buy coffee.
 * The robot may get wet if there is rain and it doesn’t carry any umbrella.
 * The robot doesn’t make any observation when it gets coffee,
 * however it observes (with some noise) whether the user wants coffee when
 * executing the checkWC action. The robot earns rewards when the user wants
 * coffee and has coffee, and it is penalized otherwise. The robot is further
 * penalized if it gets wet. A small cost of 1.0 is incurred each time it gets
 * coffee, and 0.5 e ach time it checks whether the user wants coffee.
